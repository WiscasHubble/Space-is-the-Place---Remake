      info: 'The V-2, originally called the A-4, was a key development in rocketry, marking the shift from small experimental devices to large weapons systems and paving the way for spaceflight. Developed in Germany during WWII by Dr. Wernher von Braun’s team, it featured innovative cooling methods for its engine. Entered late in the war, it was used against London and Belgium but was more a tool of terror than a war changer. After the war, the U. S. and Soviets captured and learned from V-2s, leading to the creation of their rocket programs. The V-2 also helped launch early space probes. A model of the V-2 from a Revell kit is showcased in a diorama, with components displayed for better visibility.',

A month later, on November 3, 1957, they launched Sputnik 2, which carried the dog Laika into orbit, showing that the USSR aimed to send humans into space. At this time, the US could have launched a satellite first, but President Eisenhower intentionally let the USSR take the lead to highlight the difference between space and air overflight. Later, US spy programs revealed that the US actually had a substantial lead in nuclear missiles, contrary to the impression given by early Soviet space successes',

      info: 'The Soyuz rocket has been the most widely used booster for manned space flight in history, originating from the Soviet Unions R-7 ICBM developed in the early 1950s. The first test flight occurred in 1957, and the same rocket launched Sputnik, the first artificial Earth satellite, that October. The R-7 features a central core stage with four strap-on boosters, all utilizing kerosene and liquid oxygen fuel. Over the years, upper stages have been added to increase lift capacity, enabling missions like Luna 1 and the Vostok launcher, which put the first men in orbit in 1961. Since 1967, variations have been used to launch Soyuz manned spacecraft. The Soyuz booster is still active today, regularly launching crews to the ISS and other satellites. Russian engineering emphasizes simplicity and reliability, which is evident in the long history of the Soyuz booster. The Soyuz T model is based on specific kits, with personal details about a launch experience in 1992 available.',

      info: 'The Atlas was Americas first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), developed in the 1950s, shortly after the Soviet R-7 rocket. Both missiles were their nations first ICBMs and had similarities, such as being fueled by kerosene and liquid oxygen, and having a 1 1/2 stage design. The core stage and the booster engines fired on the ground, with the boosters dropping off after a few minutes. Both the Atlas and the R-7 were later modified to launch the first men into orbit, though the first two Americans in space used the smaller Mercury-Redstone. The Atlas was smaller and had less lift capacity than the R-7 due to advanced American thermonuclear weapon technology. Variants of both rockets are still in use today. The text also mentions a model of the last Mercury-Atlas launch vehicle, MA-9 or Faith 7, featuring Gordon Coopers 22 orbits in May 1963. The model is based on the Eagles Talon kit and Revells Mercury-Gemini kit.',

The Voskhod was a modified Vostok, allowing multiple crew members. This mission marked the end of major Soviet space achievements before the US Gemini program surpassed many records. After Leonov’s walk, the US quickly planned its own spacewalks. This model is based on the East German Plasticart 1/25 Vostok kit, and the Leonov figure is modified from a figure of General George Patton.',

      info: 'The Titan II was a second-generation American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), developed after the Atlas ICBM. The Atlas required hours to prepare for launch due to challenges with loading super cold liquid oxygen. In contrast, the Titan II used propellants that could be stored at room temperature and burned on contact, making it easier to launch. It was more effective than the Atlas and was stored in nuclear-hardened silos across the US. The Titan II also served as a booster for the Gemini spacecraft, which completed ten missions in 1965 and 1966. Eventually, Titan IIs were replaced by faster launching missiles like the Minuteman. There are two models of the Gemini-Titan II in the Shrine, showcasing detailing work and special features to simulate smoke and flame.',

The Saturn concept involved combining tanks and engines from smaller rockets for heavy lifting. The Saturn I was the first, using hydrogen/oxygen fuels in its second stage.

Kennedys goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. Three methods for the mission were considered: Direct Ascent, Earth Orbit Rendezvous, and Lunar Orbit Rendezvous. Direct Ascent was initially favored, but it posed challenges such as needing a large spacecraft to land on and take off from the Moons surface. The Saturn C-8 included four stages with powerful engines, but due to height restrictions of the Vehicle Assembly Building, its design was limited. Ultimately, Lunar Orbit Rendezvous was chosen to simplify the mission, leading to developments in the Gemini program. This model was made using a resin kit from Martins Models in the UK.',

Unlike the American Apollo program, which used one spacecraft for different types of missions, the Soviets had separate spacecraft and boosters for these missions.
